# 101
Hi!

I'm teaching myself how to code and here this is a repository where I throw some of the solutions to tasks I've come across while learning how to code. Hopefully, they will help someone who is stuck as I have been many times while studying.

Newest: Cheapest option - A Python CLI application to find out the cheapest options according to the given dates.

New: Would you like to play with a dice?

Enjoy!
